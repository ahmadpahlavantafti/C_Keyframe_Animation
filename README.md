# C_Keyframe_Animation
3D Key-frame animation using C++ and OpenGL.
In this project, I have implemented a key-frame animation with the following specification: 
should define two key frames either in the source code or with a GUI. Must specify the translation, 
scaling and rotation parameters from the first key-frame (t = 0) to the second key-frame (t = 1). 
I used linear interpolation to interpolate the translation vector and scaling factor between the two key-frames, 
by assuming the initial translation vector as (0, 0, 0) and initial scaling factor as 1. 
Source code (C++ & OpenGL) is available in this repository.
